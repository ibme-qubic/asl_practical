<div id="practical">
<h1 class="centred">Arterial Spin Labelling Practical</h1>

<p>In this practical you will learn how to use the BASIL tools in FSL
  to analyse ASL data, specifically to obtain quantiative images of
  perfusion (in units of ml/100 g/min), as well as other haemodynamic
  parameters. For the puproses of the practical you will be instructed
  to use the BASIL GUI, all of the same analyses (and more) can be
  achieve dusing command line tools, as you will see in the
  accompanying lecture. This practical is a shorter version of the
  examples that accompany the Primer: Introduction to Neuroimaging
  using Arterial Spin Labelling. On the website for the primer you can
  find more emxaples than we have time for on the FSL course,
  including instructions for using both the GUI and command line
  tools.</p>

  <p> NOTE that if you are follwing this practial outside of the FSL
  course you should ensure you are using the pre-release of BASIL
  alongside a recent version of FSL v5. This can be found by following

<hr/>

  <h2><a name="singlepld">Perfusion quantification using Single PLD pcASL</a></h2>

  <p>The aim of this exercise is to perform perfusion quantification
  with one of the most widely recommened variants of ASL. Single PLD
  pcASL is now regarded as sufficiently simple and reliable, boht for
  acquisition and analysis, that it is the first option most people
  should consider when using ASL for the first time in a
  study. Although more can be done with other ASL variants,
  particularly when acquisition time allows.</p>

  <h3>The data</h3>
  
  <p>Take a look inside the data directory:</p>

  <pre class="bash">
  cd ~/fsl_course_data/ASL
  ls
  </pre>

  <p>This dataset used <b>pcASL labeling</b> and we are going to start
  with data collected using a <b>single post-label
  delay</b>. This dataset follows as closely as posisble the
  recommendations of the ASL Consensus Paper on a good general purpose
  ASL acquisition, although we have chosen to use a 2D mutli-slice
  readout rather than a full-volume 3D readout.</p>

  <p><list>The files you will need to begin with are:
  <li><code>spld_asltc.nii.gz</code> - the label-control ASL series containing 60
  volumes. That is 30 label and 30 control, in pairs of alternating images with
  label first.</li>
  <li><code>aslcalib.nii.gz</code> - the calibration image, a (largely) proton-density
  weighted image with the same readout (resolution etc) as the main
  ASL data. The TR for this data is 4.8 seconds, which means there
  will be some T1 weighting.</li>
  <li><code>aslcalib_PA.nii.gz</code> - another calibration image,
  identical to <code>aslcalib.nii.gz</code> apart from the use of
  posterior-anterior phase encoding (anterior-posterior was used in
  the rest of the ASL data). This is provided for distortion
  correction.</li>
  <li><code>T1.nii.gz</code> - the T1-weigthed anatomical of the same
  subject.</li>
  </list>

  <h3>Look at the data</h3>

  <p>It is always a good idea to take a look at the raw data just to
  check that nothing has gone horribly wrong in the acquisition and
  ensure you know exactly what you are dealing with. </p>
  <list> There are two
  separate files that contain the ASL data we need:
  <li>asltc - this contains 60 volumes and is repeated
  measurements of alternating label and control images (in that
  order).</li>
  <li>aslcalib - this is the calibration image (only a single volume),
  it is effectively a proton density image acquired with the same
  readout as the ASL data. In this case the TR was 4.8 seconds, which
  means there will be some T1 weighting that we might want to correct for.</li>
  </list>

<p>View these images in fsleyes:</p>
  
  <pre class="bash">
fsleyes aslcalib.nii.gz -dr 0 1500 asltc.nii.gz -dr 0 1500
  </pre>

  <p>
  <list>
  Notice that:
<li>There is a marked intensity difference between the calibration image and the label-control data. This is because background suppression was applied when acquiring the label-control data, as recommended by the ASL consensus paper, to reduce the influence of motion and physiological noise sources.</li>
<li>It is very hard to spot differecnes between label and control
  images - try using the movie mode of fsleyes, you might find it
  helpful to set the display range for the <code>asltc.nii.gz</code> image as 0 to
500 now.</li>
<li>There is an alternating pattern in the timeseries of the
  label-control data, but it is small compared to the mean signal
  intensity in any given voxel. To see this use the timeseries mode in
  fsleyes, you will need to choose a voxel in cotrical gray matter
  (where there will be the largest perfusion signal) e.g. [20,14,13].</li>
  </list>
  </p>

  <h3>A Perfusion-Weighted Image </h3>

<p>Since the data looks okay we can proceed to the calculation of a
  perfusion-weighted image (PWI). For this we will use the 'preview'
  feature of the BASIL GUI, essentially we are generating the PWI to check
  that the data is okay for further analysis.</p>

<p>  To launch the GUI at the command line you will need to type
  <code>asl_gui</code>. Note that if you have downloaded the
  'pre-release' yourself, you may need to provide a path to the
  installed version of the GUI, e.g. <code>/Users/{blah}/Downloads/oxford_asl/asl.gui</code></p>

  <p>Once it has launched you
  will find yourself on the 'Input Data' tab, you
  should:</p>
  <list>
  <li>Load the ASL data <code>asltc.nii.gz</code> as the 'Input
  Image'.</li>
  <li>Set the 'Number of PLDs', which in this case is 1, this is
  already done by default.</li>
  <li>Click the 'Update' button beneath the 'Data Preview' pane on the right.</li>
  </list>

  <p> At this point the GUI should look like the screen shot below and
  a PWI will have appeared in the 'Data Preview' pane. This this is reassuring, if we didn't see something that
  looks roughly like this, we might check if the data order that the
  GUI is expecting matches that in the data. We could alter the 'Data
  order' settings if needed and update the preview again'. </p>

  <img src="PWI.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI previewing perfusion-weighted
  image" width=900>
  
  <p>Note also, beneath the 'Data Preview', that there is a 'Data order
  preview'. The idea of this graphic is to help visually to confirm
  that the way that the GUI is intepreting the ordering of volumes in
  the data matches what you are expecting. In this case we have a
  single PLD repeated 30 times with the label and control images
  paired in the data (this is pretty common). What the 'Data order
  preview' shows is the first instance of the PLD in purple, showing
  both the label and control (hatched) volume. Each subsequent repeat
  of the same PLD is coloured green, again showing that we have a
  label follwed by control (hatched) volume.</p>

  <p>You can try a different 'Data order' option to see what
  happens. Change 'Label/Control pairs' from 'Label then control' to
  'Control then label'. This switches the expected order of label and
  control images within the pair. If you then udpate the preview you
  will find that the contrast reverses, the perfusion now has the
  wrong 'sign'.
  </list>


   <h3>(Simple) Perfusion Quantification</h3>

  <p>We have checked the PWI, thus we
  can proceed to final quantification of perfusion, inverting the
  kinetics of the ASL label delivery and using the calibration
image to get values in the units of ml/100g/min.</p>

<p>To do this we need to tell the BASIL GUI some information about the
  data and the analysis we want to perform.</p>

  <list>On the 'Input Data' tab we need to sepcify the 'Acquisition parameters':
  <li> Labelling - cASL/pcASL (the deafult option).</li>
  <li> Bolus duration (s) - 1.8 (default).</li>
  <li> PLDs (s) - 1.8 (default).</li>
  <li> Readout - 2D multi-slice (you will need to set this).</li>
  <li> Time per slice (ms) - 45.2 (only appears when you change the
  Readout option).</li>
  </list>

  <p>You can now hit 'Next' and you will be taken to the next tab. For
  this (simple) analysis we do not want to use a structural image, so
  we can move on by clicking 'Next' again. Or we could skip stright to
  the 'Calibration' tab using the menu across the top.</p>

  <p>On the 'Calibration' tab, 'Enable Calibration' first, then load
  the calibration image <code>aslcalib.nii.gz</code>. Change the
  'Calibration mode' to 'voxelwise', and set the 'Sequence TR (s)' to
  be 4.8.</p>

  <img src="Calib.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Calibration" width=900>
  
  <p>Finally, we need to set the analysis options: either skip to the
  'Analysis' tab or click 'Next' twice.</p>

  <p>On the 'Analysis' tab, choose an output directory name, e.g.,
  <code>oxasl</code>. And, select 'Analysis which conforms to White
  Paper', so that we know the analysis is using the same default
  parameter values proposed in the ' ASL White Paper' quantification
  formula. Note that in the lower left corner the GUI is now telling
  us that we are 'Ready to Go'. At this point you can click 'Run' in
  the lower right corner.</p>

  <img src="Analysis.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Analysis" width=900>
  

<p>To view the final result:</p>
<pre class="bash">
fsleyes oxasl/native_space/perfusion_calib.nii.gz
  </pre>

  <p>Note that if you just supply a name for the output directory (not
  a full path), as we have here, this will be placed in the 'working
  directory', i.e. whicheveer directory you were in when you launched
  the GUI.</p>
  
<p>You will find something that looks very similar to the PWI we viewed before, but now the values at every voxel are in ml/100g/min.</p>

<p>You will also find a PWI saved as
<code>oxasl/native_space/perfusion</code>. This is very similar to the
PWI displayed in the preview pane, except that the kinetic
model inversion has been applied to it, this is the image
  pre-calibration.</p>

  <hr/>
  <h2><a name="singlepldmore">Improving the Perfusion Images from
  single PLD pcASL</a></h2>

<p>The purpose of this practical is essentially to do a better job of
the analysis we did above, exploring more of the features of the GUI
including things like motion and distortion correction.</p>

 <h3>Motion and Distortion correction</h3>

<p> Go back to the GUI which should still be setup from the last
analysis you did (if you have closed it follow the steps above to
repeat the setup - but do not click run).</p>

  <p>On the 'Distortion Correction' tab, select 'Apply distortion
  correction'. Load the 'Phase-encode-reveresed calibration image'
  <code>aslcalib_PA.nii.gz</code>. Set the 'Effective EPI echo
  spacing' to 0.06 and the 'Phase encoding direction' to 'y'.</p>

   <img src="Dist.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI previewing perfusion-weighted
  image" width=900>

  <p>On the 'Analysis' tab, select 'Motion Correction'. Make sure you
  have 'Adaptive spatial regularisation on perfusion' selected (it is
by default). This will reduce the appearance of noise in the final
  perfusion image using the
  minimum ammount of smoothing appropriate for the data. Now click 'Run'.</p>

 <img src="Analysis2.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Analysis" width=900>
  
<p>For this analysis we are still in 'White
Paper' mode.Specifically this means we are using
  simplest kinetic model that assumes all delivered blood-water has
  the same T1 as that of blood (see Chapter 4 of the ASL primer for
  more information) and that the Arterial Transit Time should be
  treated as 0 seconds.</p>

<p>To view the final result:</p>
<pre class="bash">
fsleyes oxasl/native_space/perfusion_calib.nii.gz
  </pre>

<p>The result will be similar to the analysis in <a href="../ex1GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a> although the effect of distortion
  correction should be noticeable in the anterior protion of the
  brain. The effects of motion correction are less obvious, this
data does not have a lot of motion corruption in it.</p>

 <h3>Making use of Structural Images</h3>

  <p>Thus far all of the analyses have relied purely on the ASL data
  alone. However, often you will have a (higher resolution) structural
  image in the same subject and would like to use this as well, at the
  very least as part of the proceess to transform the perfusion images into some
  template space.</p>

  <p>We can repeat the analysis above but now providing structural
  information. The recommended way to do
  this is to take your T1 weighted structural image (which is most
  common) and firstly process using <code>fsl_anat</code>, passing the
output directly from that tool BASIL. </p>

<p>For this practical <code>fsl_anat</code> has already been run for
you and you will find the output in the data directory as <code>~/fsl_course_data/singlePLDpcASL/T1.anat</code></p>

<p>Go back to the analysis you have setup above. On the 'Structure'
tab, for 'Structural data from' select 'Existing FSL_ANAT
output'. Then for the 'Existing FSL_ANAT output' choose <code>T1.anat</code>.</p> 

   <img src="Struct.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Structure" width=900>

  <p>This analysis will take longer overall, although the extra time
  is taken up doing registration between ASL and structural
  images. 

  <p>You will now find some new results in the output
  directory:</p>
  <list>
  <li> <code>oxasl/struct_space</code> - this sub-drectory contains results
  transformed into the same space as the structural image. The
 files in here will match those in the <code>native_space</code>
  subdirectry of the earlier analysis, i.e., containing perfusion
images with and without calibration.</li>
<li> <code>oxasl/native_space/asl2struct.mat</code> - this is the
  (linear) transformation between ASL and structural space. It can be
  used along with a transformation between sturcutral and template
  space to transform the ASL data into the template space. It was used
  to create the results in <code>oxasl/struct_space</code>.</li>
<li> <code>oxasl/native_space/perfusion_calib_gm_mean.txt</code> -
  this contains the result of calculating the perfusion within a gray
  matter mask, these are in ml/100g/min. The mask was derived from the partial volume estimates
  created by <code>fsl_anat</code> and transformed into ASL space
  followed by thresholding at 70%. This is a helpful check on the
  absolute perfusion values found and it is not aytpical too see
  values in the range 30-50 here. There is also a white matter result
(for which a threshold of 90% was used).</li>
<li> <code>oxasl/native_space/gm_mask.nii.gz</code> - this is the gray
  matter mask used in the above calculations. There is also the
  associated white matter mask.</li>
  <li> <code>oxasl/native_space/gm_roi.nii.gz</code> - this is another
  mask that represents areas in which there is some grey matter (at
  least 10% from the partial volume estimates). This can be useful for
  visualisation, but mainly when looking at partial volume corrected
  data.</li>
  </list>

  <h3>Reference Tissue Calibration</h3>
  
  <p>Thus far the calibration to get perfsion in units of ml/100g/min
  has been done using a voxelwise division of the realtive perfusion
  image by the (suitably corrected) calibration image - so called
  'voxelwise' calibration. This is in keeping with the recommendations
  of the ASL White Paper for a simple to implement quantitative
  analysis. However, we could also choose to use a reference tissue to
  derive a single value for the equilirbirum mangetization of arterial
  blood and use that in the calibnration process.</p>

  <p>Go back to the analysis you have already set up. We are now going
  to turn off 'White Paper' mode, this will provide us with more
  options to get a potentially more accurate analysis. To do this return to the 'Analysis' tab
  and deselect the 'White Paper' option, you will see that the
  'Arterial Transit Time' goes from 0 seconds to 1.3 seconds (the
  default value for pcASL in BASIL based on our experience with pcASL
  labeling plane placement) and the 'T1' value (for tissue) is
  different to 'T1b' (for arterial blood), since the Standard (aka
  Buxton) model for ASL kinetics considers labeled blood both in the
  vascualture and the tissue.</p>

    <img src="Analysis3.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Analysis" width=900>

<p> Now that we are not in 'White Paper' mode we can also change the
  calibration method. On the 'Calibration' tab, change the 'Calibration mode' to 'Reference
  Region'. Now all of the 'Reference tissue' options will become
  available, but leave these as they are: we will accept the default
  option of using the CSF (in the ventricles) for calibration.</p>

  <img src="Calib2.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Calibration" width=900>

  <list>You could click 'Run' now and wait for the analysis to
  complete. But, in the interests of time we will save ourselves the
  bother of doing all of the registration all over again. Before
  clicking run, therefore, do:
  <li> On the 'Calibration' tab select 'Mask' and load
  <code>csfmask.nii.gz</code> from the data directory. This is a ready
  prepared ventricular mask for this subject. (in fact it is precisely
the mask you would get if you ran the analysis as setup above).</li>
<li> Go back to the 'Structure' tab and choose 'None' for 'Structural
  data from'. This will turn off all of the registration
processes.</li>
</list>

  <p>The resulting perfusion images should look very similar to those
  produced using the voxelwise calibration, and the absolute values
  should be similar too. For this, and many datasets, the two methods
  are broadly equivalent. You can check on some of the interim
  calcuations for the calibration by looking in the
  <code>oxasl/calib</code> subdirectory: here you will find the value
  of the estimated equilirbirum mangetization of arterial blood for
  this dataset in <code>M0.txt</code> and the reference tissue mask in
  <code>refmask.nii.gz</code>. It is worth checking that the latter
  does indeed only lie in the venticles when overlaid on an ASL image
  (e.g. the perfusion image or the calibration image), it should be
  conservative, i.e., only select voxels well within the ventricles
and not on the boundary with white matter.</p>

<h3>Partial Volume Correction</h3>

  <p>Having dealt with structural image and in the process obtained
  partial volume estimates we are now in a position to do partial
  volume correction. This does more than simply attempt to estimate
  the mean perfusion within the grey matter by the definition of an
  ROI based on the partial voume estimates, but attempts to derive and
  image of gray matter perfusion directly (along with a separate image
  for white matter).</p>

<p>This is very simple to do via the GUI. Return to your earlier analysis and now on the 'Analysis' tab
select 'Partial Volume Correction'. That is it! You might not want to
click 'Run' at this point becuase partial volume correction takes
substantially longer to run.</p>

<p>If you do run this analysis (later), in the results directory you will still find an analysis performed
without partial volume correction in <code>oxasl/native_space</code>
as before. The results of partial volume correction can be found in
<code>oxasl/native_space/pvcorr</code>. This new subdirectory has the
same structure as the non-corrected results, only now
<code>perfusion_calib.nii.gz</code> is an estimate of perfusion only
in gray matter, it has been joined by a new set of images for the
estimation of white matter perfusion, e.g.,
<code>perfusion_wm_calib.nii.gz</code>. It may be more helpful to look at
<code>perfusion_calib_masked.nii.gz</code> (and the equivalent
<code>perfusion_wm_calib_masked.nii.gz</code>) since this has been
masked to include only voxels with more than 10% gray matter (or white
matter), i.e., voxels in which it is reasonable to interpret the gray
matter (white matter) perfusion values.</p>

<hr/>

<h2><a name="multipld">Perfusion Quantification (and more) using
Multi-PLD pcASL</a></h2>

<p>The purpsoe of this exercise is to look at some multi-PLD pcASL. As
with the single PLD data we can obtain perfusion images, but now we
can account for any differences in the arrival of labeled blood-water
(the arterial transit time, ATT) in different parts of the brain. As we
will also see we can extract other interesting paramerts, such as the
ATT in its own right, as well as arterial blood volumes.</p>

<h3>The data</h3>

 <p>The data we wil use in this section supplements the single PLD pcASL data above, adding
  multi-PLD ASL in the same subject (collected in the same
  session). This dataset used the same pcASL labelling, but with a
  label duration of 1.4 seconds and 6 post-labelling delays of 0.25,
  0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 seconds.</p>

  <p><list>The files you will also now need are:
  <li><code>mpld_asltc.nii.gz</code> - the label-control ASL series
  containing 96 volumes: each PLD was repeated 8 times, thus there are
  16 volumes (label and control paired) for each PLD. The order in
  which these was collected was a full set of PLD, followed
  by another, etc.</li>

   <h3>Perfusion Quantification </h3>

  <p>Load the GUI (<code>Asl</code> or <code>Asl_gui</code>). On the
  'Input Data' tab, for the 'Input Image' load
  <code>mpld_asltc.nii.gz</code>. Unlike the single-PLD data, we need to specify the correct number
  of PLD, which is 6. At this point the 'Number of repeats' should
  correctly read 8. Click 'Update' below the 'Data preview pane'. A
  perfusion-weighted image should appear - this is an average over all
  the PLDs (and will thus look different to <a href="../ex1GUI/index.html"
  target="dynamic">Example 1</a>).</p>

  <p>Note the 'Data order preview'. For mutli-PLD ASL it is important
  to get the data order specification right. In this case the default
  options in the GUI are correct: the PLDs come as label-control
  pairs, i.e. alternating label then control images; a full set of the
  6 PLDs has been acquired first, then this has been repeated 8
  subseqeunt times, this is indcated in the preview by colouring the
  first instance of a PLD as purple and subsequent as green, with
  different PLDs appearing as different shase of purple (or
green). Getting a plausible looking PWI is a good sign that the data
  order is correct, but it is not a guarantee that the PLD ordering is
  correct, so always check carefully.</p>

<list>Once we are happy with the PWI and data order, we can set the
'Acquisition parameters':
<li>Labelling - 'cASL/pcASL' (default).</li>
<li>Bolus duration (s) - 1.4 (shorter than the default).</li>
<li>PLDs (s) - 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.254, 1.5. </li>
<li>Readout - '2D multi-slice' with 'TIme per slice' 45.2.</li>
</list>

<img src="Input2.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Input Data" width=900>

<p>Move to the 'Calibration' tab, select 'Enable Calibration' and as
the 'Calibration Image' load the <code>aslcalib.nii.gz</code> image
from the Single-PLD data (it is from the same subject in the same
session so we can use it here too). We have skipped the 'Structure'
tab (to make the analysis quicker), this means if we want 'Calibration
mode' to be 'Reference Region' we need to supply a mask of the
region of tissue to use. Select 'Mask' and load
<code>csfmask.nii.gz</code>. Set the 'Sequence TR' to be 4.8, but
leave all of the other options alone.</p>

<img src="Calib3.jpeg" alt="BASIL GUI Calibration" width=900>

<p>Move to the 'Distortion Correction' tab. Select 'Apply disotrion
correction'. Load the 'Phase-encode-reveresed calibration image'
  <code>aslcalib_PA.nii.gz</code> from the Single-PLD pcASL data. Set the 'Effective EPI echo
spacing' to 0.06 and the 'Phase encoding direction' to 'y'.</p>

<p>Finally, move to the 'Analysis' tab. Choose an output directory,
leave all of the other options alone. Click 'Run'.</p>

  <p>The results directory from this analysis should look similar to
  that obtained for the single PLD pcASL. That is reassuring as it is the same subject. The main difference is the
  <code>arrival.nii.gz</code> image. If you examine this image you should find a pattern of values
  that tells you the time it takes for blood to transit between the
  labeling and imaging regions. You might notice that the
  <code>arrival.nii.gz</code> image was present even in the single-PLD
  results, but if you looked at it contained a single value - the one
  set in the Analysis tab - which meant that it
appeared blank in that case.</p>


<h3>Arterial/Macrovascular Signal Correction</h3>

  <p>In the analysis above we didn't attempt to model the presence of
  arterial (macrovascular) signal. This is fairly
  reasonable for pcASL in general, since we can only start sampling
  some time after the first arrival of labeled blood-water in the
  imaging region. However, given we are using shorter PLD in our
  multi-PLD sampling to improve the SNR there is a much greater
  likelihood of arterial signal being present. Thus, we might like to
repeat the analysis with this component included</p>

<p>Return to your analysis from before. On the 'Analysis' tab select
'Include macro vascular component'. Click 'Run'.</p>

The results directory should be almost identical to the
  previous run, but now we also gain some new results:
  <code>aCBV.nii.gz</code> and
  <code>aCBV_calib.nii.gz</code>; following the convention for the
  perfusion images, these are the relative and absolute arterial
  (cerebral) blood volumes respectively. If you examine one of these
  and focus on the more inferior slices you should see a pattern of
  higher values that map out the structure of the major arterial
  vasculature, including the Circle of Willis. This finding of an
  arterial contribution in some voxels results in a correction to the
  perfusion image - you may now be able to spot that in the same
  slices where there was some evidence for arterial contamination of
the perfusion image before that has now been removed.</p>

<h2>Partial Volume Correction</h2>

<p>In the same way that we could do
partial volume correction for single PLD pcASL, we can do this
for multi-PLD. If anything partial volume correction should be even
better for multi-PLD ASL, as there is more information in the data to
separate grey and white matter perfusion.</p>

<p>Just like the single PLD case we will require structural
information, entered on the 'Structure' tab. We can do as we did
before and load <code>T1.anat</code>. On the 'Analysis' tab, select
'Partial Volume Correction'.</p>

<p>Again, this analysis will not be very quick and so you might not
wish to click 'Run' right now.</p>

<p>If you do run this analysis, the results directory will now contain, as a further subdirectory, <code>pvcorr</code>,
within the <code>native_space</code> subdirectory, the partial volume
corrected results: gray matter (<code>perfusion_calib.nii.gz</code>
etc) and white matter perfusion
(<code>perfusion_wm_calib.nii.gz</code> etc)
maps. Alongside these there are also gray and white matter ATT maps
(<code>arrival</code> and <code>arrival_wm</code> respectively). The
estimated maps for the arterial component
(<code>aCBV_calib.nii.gz</code> etc) are still present in the
<code>pvcorr</code> directory. Since this is not tissue specific there
are not separate gray and white matter versions of this parameter.</p>
